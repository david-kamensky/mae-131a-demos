# Solving for force and displacement in 2D trusses
These examples demonstrate how to solve systematically for member and reaction forces in determinate trusses (`truss_determinate.m`) and for joint displacements in indeterminate trusses (`truss_determinate.m`).  The indeterminate case is slightly outside the scope of the course, but included here for completeness.  The determinate case should be review from statics (viz., the "method of joints"), although the approach to encoding a general truss geometry and connectivity into arrays and indexing the problem's unknowns in a linear equation system may take some effort to understand.
